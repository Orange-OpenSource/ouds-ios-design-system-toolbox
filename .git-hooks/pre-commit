# Software description: A SwiftUI components library with code examples for Orange Unified Design System
#

# pre-commit hook to format Swift sources before submitting them to remote
# Checks also if some files have been modified and stagde even if they are supposed to be excluded.
# Ensures source code is always formatted without leak of touchy files.

# Configuration
# -------------

export PATH="$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin"

formatterExec=$(which swiftformat)

# List of files for which, supposing they exist and are empty, must not have changes 
# (supposing in that case the original version and not empty are commited which is not acceptable)
# See Orange-OpenSource/ouds-ios#1066
exclusion_list=("HelveticaNeueLTArabic-Bold.ttf" "HelveticaNeueLTArabic-Light.ttf" "HelveticaNeueLTArabic-Roman.ttf")

# Functions
# ---------
